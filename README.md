# Moraliser

Evolution of Strategies for Cooperation

## Dependencies

python3, mesa, numpy, matplotlib

## How to run code

There is a demo with some GUI provided by Mesa in `gui.py`. To run it:

In the command line, change the working directory to `moraliser/`, then

```commandline
python3 gui.py
```

You can also run the `PDModel` instance in a separated test python file on your own, for running code without GUI is way more efficient and suitable
for data analysis.

Please refer to `run.py` and `load.py` for data analysis example.
