# Moraliser

Evolution of Strategies for Cooperation

## Dependencies

python3, mesa, numpy, matplotlib

## How to run code

There is a demo with some GUI provided by Mesa in `lib/server.py`. To run it:

In the command line, change the working directory to `moraliser/`, then

```commandline
python3 lib/server.py
```

You can also run the `PDModel` instance in a separated test python file on your own, for running code without GUI is way more efficient and suitable for data analysis.
